# My Portfolio Full Stack Website

A react-based website dedicated to the Portfolio Projects by Kelly Hutchison

I am a full stack junior developer and this website is designed to showcase my skills and provide evidence of those skills through projects that have been 100% developed by me. 

The projects are held in a backend REST API, as well as any messages you send me and comments posted about my projects. All comments and feedback are most welcome!

[Link to deployed backend API](https://portfolio-api-kelz-08cd4ce9622d.herokuapp.com/)

The frontend and backend sites are both deployed through Heroku, and the API data is stored using ElephantSQL.

## Credits

1. In order to make a more interesting style navbar, I wanted to try something new and create a sidebar links panel which remained in place whilst the rest of the page can scroll up and down. A sort of sticky side footer. I looked at this[Stack Overflow Article](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60482018/make-a-sidebar-from-react-bootstrap) as an example.
